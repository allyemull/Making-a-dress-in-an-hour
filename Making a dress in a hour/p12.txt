Step Nine-Make the Belt

1 Fold Lengthwise
2 Stitch with Â¼-inch seam
3 Turn belt right side out
4 Fold 5-inch piece 
of belt like this
5 Fold 2-inch piece of belt around

1. Fold lengthwise the 2-inch strip of material 
torn off for the belt, with the right side in.

2. Stitch the material the full length, about
1/4 inch from the torn edge and across one end.

3. Turn the belt right side out. An easy way to do this is 
to place the blunt end of a pencil against the end seam and pull 
the belt down over it. Push up on the pencil and down on the belt 
until it is turned right side out. Then slip out the pencil.
Press the belt and stitch across the open end.

Make Tailored Bow for Belt

4. Cut off piece of belt material 5 inches long. Fold ends 
over to meet in center and tack down.

5. Cut off another piece 2 
inches long, fold around the first 
piece at center and tack down.
Sew the bow to one end of 
finished belt. If belt will slip 
over your shoulders, sew both 
ends of belt to bow. If not, 
put snap fastener on bow and one 
end of belt.

Here are two attrac-
tive variations of the
One Hour Dress, one 
a smart evening frock, 
the other a street 
dress.
The evening frock 
is of Canton crêpe 
with ribbon girdle of 
contrasting colors and 
rosette of lace 
centered with several 
colors of chenille 
yarn. The sleeves are
cut shorter, and the 
skirt is cut in one
piece, a tier tuck 
using up the surplus 
length and belt allow-
ance.
With the skirt
material folded as it comes from the store, the tuck is made 
3 1/2 to 4 1/2 inches above the fold, the fold making it unnecessary 
to measure or mark for the tuck. The fullness at each side 
is folded in a deep plait, the inside edge toward the front.
When the twisted girdle is put in place, the extra fullness in the 
skirt and blouse is folded in directly over the skirt plaits and tacked, 
thus producing a desirable plain front and back. A binding of 
self-material is applied to the sleeves and the neck and this is 
turned to the right side and the stitching line made directly in 
the center of the binding.
The street dress is of wool crêpe with trimming of latticed 
silk braid in deeper color. Four inverted plaits, each 1½ inches 
deep, two on each side of the braid, use up the fullness on each 
side of the skirt. After the plaits are pressed in, the waist portion 
is pinned over the skirt and the additional fullness in the waist is 
laid in plaits at the sides, as shown. Thus, with the blouse 
portion fitted almost as close as a bodice, a belt is unnecessary.
Binding of self-material is used for the neck, turned to the 
right side, and stitched in the center. The cuffs are joined to 
the sleeve with a plain seam and their edges are turned to the 
right side and stitched the same as for a cascade finish.

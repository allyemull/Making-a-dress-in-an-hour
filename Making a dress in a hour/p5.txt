Step Three-Cut Out Belt and Skirt

1 Measure off 2 inches           Selvage
2 Tear off for Belt
4 If material is deeper than your skirt length, cut or tear here
3 Measure off your skirt length
FRONT         SKIRT         BACK
5 Cut or tear here

You now take the larger piece of material and from it cut t
he belt and skirt.

1. Measure off 2 inches from one selvage edge.

2. Cut or tear off this 2-inch strip the full length of the selvage 
edge. This is for the belt.

3. Measure off from the other selvage edge your skirt length.

4. If material is deeper than your skirt length, cut or tear 
off the extra amount.

5. Fold the large remaining piece together 
crosswise and cut or tear into two equal parts.
One is for the front of your skirt, the other for 
the back.

NOTE.â€”Short figures will have a surplus strip of 
material cut from the upper part of the skirt. This 
material may be used, if desired, as a hem 
for the skirt instead of the selvage-edge 
finish, or as a wide sash instead of the 
narrow sash belt, or it adding a cuff to 
the sleeve.

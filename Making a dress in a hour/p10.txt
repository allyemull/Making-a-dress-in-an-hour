Step Seven-Complete the Skirt
2 Turn edge
⅜ inch
and crease

1 Clip material
⅜ inch here

3 Fold again
⅜ inch 
and stitch 
along center

You are now ready to complete the front section of the skirt
by making an imitation binding as a finish for each side.

1. Clip the skirt material 3/8 inch deep at each corner where 
the blouse and skirt join.

2. Turn over the edge of the skirt material 3/8 inch and crease 
from the clip out to the corner and all the way down the side 
to the bottom.

3. Turn it again a generous 3/8 inch, making a double fold, and 
crease. Now stitch directly along the center of the fold all the 
way. The result will be an imitation binding as shown above.
Finish both sides of the front skirt section the same way. A 
darning stitch made with rope or heavy embroidery silk may be 
used instead of the stitching if desired.

NOTE—The 3/8-inch clipping should come in far enough so that when 
the under-arm seam is stitched the clipped place will come in line with the stitching and thus be concealed and at the same time made more secure.

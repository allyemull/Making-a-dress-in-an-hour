Step Ten-Finish the Dress

You are now ready to put the finishing 
touches on your "One Hour Dress" by 
tacking the skirt at the sides and putting 
on the belt.

1. Put the dress on. Lift up the front
of the skirt. Bring both sides of the back 
skirt section around underneath the front 
and pin them in place, so that when the 
dress is removed they can be tacked securely.
When the front section is dropped, the cascades at each side 
should be pinned to the back section of the skirt so they will 
appear as shown.

2. Place the belt around the waist, bring together at the 
center in the back, and pin together to mark the exact length it 
should be. Pin the belt to the blouse at each side in the proper 
position, so it can be permanently tacked when 
dress is removed.
Take off the dress. Tack the belt at each 
side. Tack the skirt down where pinned to 
the front of the blouse and along the cascades.

3. And now the dress is com-
plete. Press it and put it on and 
see what an attractive dress you 
have made.

Right Side of Material

You are now ready to apply the binding which makes an 
attractive finish for the neck and sleeves of the blouse. Use the 
ready-made bias binding or make a binding of a color that har-
monizes or contrasts pleasingly with the dress material. About 
2 or 2 1/2 yards will be required for both sleeves and neck.

1. Fold the bias binding lengthwise-not exactly in the center, 
but letting one edge extend out about 1/16 of an inch. Press the 
fold with a warm iron.

Binding the Sleeves
2. Slip the folded binding over the edge of the sleeve, with 
the widest edge of the binding underneath. Be sure the sleeve 
edge sets into the folded binding as far as it will go. Stitch the 
binding on by machine. Apply the binding in the same way to 
each sleeve.

Binding the Neck
3. Slip the folded binding over the cut edge of the neck and 
apply the same as on the sleeves. Start at the point marked a 
in the illustration above and stitch the binding around the neck.
Allow 1/4 inch to lap over when you finish again at a.

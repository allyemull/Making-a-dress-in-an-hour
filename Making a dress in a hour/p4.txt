Materials Required

Any medium firm material that does not have a definite up and
down, such as stripes, is suitable for this type of dress.

If you are more than a 38-inch bust, use 40-inch material. If 
you are less than 38, 36-inch material is satisfactory, and if you 
are less than 34, 32-inch material may be used. From 3 1/8 to 
3 1/2 yards of 36- or 40-inch material and 2 to 2 1/4 yards of binding 
are required.
If you are tall and slender, the only waste in cutting the dress 
will be that cut out in shaping the neck and the under arms.

Divide your material into two parts, one for the blouse; one 
for the skirt.

1. Measure off from one end the blouse length, and place a pin 
in the edge of the material to mark the point.

2. Clip through the selvage and cut or tear across.
The shorter part is for the blouse; the longer part for the skirt.

NOTE.-Some materials tear satisfac-
torily; others do not. The best way to 
make a crosswise division of material 
which does not tear well is to clip through 
the selvage edge and tear across. If you 
prefer to cut it, draw a crosswise thread 
and cut on the drawn thread line. Mate-
rials that pull when torn or that are 
printed or shaped unevenly on the bolt 
are more satisfactorily divided by cutting.

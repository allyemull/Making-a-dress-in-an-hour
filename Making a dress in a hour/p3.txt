Measurements Here

Blouse Length ___________inches
Skirt Length ____________inches
Hip Measure _____________inches
Armhole Measure _________inches

1. Put a pin in the dress you have on a little below your 
normal waist line, to mark the waist line for the dress you are 
to make. If you are rather short, place it 2 inches below your 
normal waist line; if medium height, 3 inches; if tall, 4 inches.
Measure from the pin over the shoulder and down the back to a 
point opposite the pin. This is the blouse length. Write it down.

2. Drop the end of tape measure about 2 inches below the 
skirt length you want and measure from there to the pin. This
is the skirt length. Write it down. The extra 2 inches will 
be taken up when the sash draws the dress in at the waist.

3. Measure around the hips at the fullest part. This is the 
hip measure. Write it down.

4. Measure around your arm at the shoulder, holding the 
tape moderately loose. This is the armhole measure. Write 
it down.

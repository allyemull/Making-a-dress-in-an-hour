Shaping the Sleeves
Fold the material again on the crosswise crease and lay it 
on the table before you in the position shown above. You now 
proceed to shape the sleeves.

6. Measure off along the bottom from the lengthwise fold
1/4 of your hip measure plus 1 1/2 inches and place a pin. (For 
example, if your hip measure is 40, measure off 1/4 of 40, or 
10 inches, plus 1½, or altogether 11½ inches.)

7. Measure down from the crosswise fold on the selvage 
edge 1/2 your armhole measure and place a pin.

8. Cut from pin to pin on a curve as the 
dotted line shows.

NOTE.—For short figures, the sleeves may need 
to be shortened, especially if 40-inch material is used.
Erect figures with full bust may need to shorten 
the back of the waist from 1 to 2 inches at the 
center back, shaping in a slanting line from 
the center back around toward the front to 
give a correct balance to the dress.

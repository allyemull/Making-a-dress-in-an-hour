For my historical book, I attempted to capture several forms of metadata, ranging technical to descriptive. Visual Studio Code provided me with technical aspects of metadata. Specifically, I was given the file names and file size. I made sure to include both: the file name for identification purposes, and the file size for technical metadata. My book is the same size throughout, but there is a small consumer card provided within it. I considered the size was important metadata to include to capture the different sizes of the document. The second form of technical metadata I considered were the pages numbers - these I chose to include for identification sake as well. The rest of the metadata selected was more descriptive, mainly chosen to capture the "feel" that the document casted on me while I was exploring it. I chose a few different categories for what visual images the author chose, ranging from drawings of women to diagrams and sewing machine images. For me, capturing the scope of visuals was important, because "how" the author depicted women revealed much about their intentions and the time period of this document. That is why I chose to capture several forms of drawings of women. Some of the pages included different forms of images, such as information about the author and a picture of her. While this did not fit into a distinct category, I felt it was important to give the female author a name and face, hence the necessity for a miscellaneous category. Other random details fit into this category additionally, including, but not limited to, the publisher's address and stamp which both were important for identification/location. Finally, for more descriptive metadata, I included categories for color, titles, subtitles, and page organization. For anyone who might not physically access the book, I thought that this descriptive metadata would help enumerate a larger picture of the booklet. These details help create a larger picture of what the document feels like, and looks like, in person. In summation, the main forms of metadata I included were technical and descriptive to provide a comprehensive understanding of this historical book.

For my historical book, I attempted to capture several forms of metadata, ranging technical to descriptive. Visual Studio Code provided me with technical aspects of metadata. Specifically, I was given the file names and file size. I made sure to include both: the file name for identification purposes, and the file size for technical metadata. My book is the same size throughout, but there is a small consumer card provided within it. I considered the size was important metadata to include to capture the different sizes of the document. The second form of technical metadata I considered were the pages numbers - these I chose to include for identification sake as well. The rest of the metadata selected was more descriptive, mainly chosen to capture the "feel" that the document casted on me while I was exploring it. I chose a few different categories for what visual images the author chose, ranging from drawings of women to diagrams and sewing machine images. For me, capturing the scope of visuals was important, because "how" the author depicted women revealed much about their intentions and the time period of this document. That is why I chose to capture several forms of drawings of women. Some of the pages included different forms of images, such as information about the author and a picture of her. While this did not fit into a distinct category, I felt it was important to give the female author a name and face, hence the necessity for a miscellaneous category. Other random details fit into this category additionally, including, but not limited to, the publisher's address and stamp which both were important for identification/location. Finally, for more descriptive metadata, I included categories for color, titles, subtitles, and page organization. For anyone who might not physically access the book, I thought that this descriptive metadata would help enumerate a larger picture of the booklet. These details help create a larger picture of what the document feels like, and looks like, in person. In summation, the main forms of metadata I included were technical and descriptive to provide a comprehensive understanding of this historical book. 

Upon extracting text from my document, OCR was mostly accurate, but I ran into a few errors with coding machines recognizing the text. I used Adobe Acrobat to read my document and translate it into text; for the most part, Acrobat did a decent job. I felt like I was a "luckier" student since I received a newer, printed book, so the words were inherently more easy to read for Acrobat's system. I feel that the newness of my document, and the higher quality of the pages (all were in tact, none handwritten, etc.) prevented excessive errors from Acrobat. Acrobat struggled with understanding a few things, however. I ran into several errors with writing numbers - my document uses fractions as measurements, and Acrobat did not recognize any of them, so I rewrote them. Additionally, Acrobat had difficulties in recognizing italics and the title font; essentially, it struggled to identify fonts that were not generic serif text. Despite these errors, my text translated fairly well and did not require major investigating or reformatting. In these moments, as well, I had to rewrite the text lines. Otherwise, Acrobat was accurate. Secondly, I pasted my OCR text into a text file in Visual Studio Code to reformat and save as a .txt file. Though all of my writing was revised to be accurate, I still felt that the essence of the book was not captured. For example, my document utilizes labelled diagrams - some of them with sideways writing - and it was hard to translate a diagram's format into a linear .txt document. In the diagrams, for example, steps to making the dress were in different spots. At some points, I was not sure whether to keep coherency (one step before another) or visually order the words/steps that the document portrayed. For me, formatting into a .txt document presented troubles because it could not physically/visually represent how data was shown in-front of me. All in all, the process of OCR and making .txt files presented some challenges with rewriting and formatting metadata.

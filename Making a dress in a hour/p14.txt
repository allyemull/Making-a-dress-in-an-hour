Variations of the One Hour Dress
The One Hour Dress offers many possibilities of variation. It 
may be made of any medium firm material-silk, wool crêpe, soft s
erge, ratiné, gingham, linen or lawn. If desired, the blouse may 
be made of figured material and the skirt of plain, or the blouse 
of plain silk with skirt of plaid or check or plain wool.
The skirt may be varied in many ways. The fullness that is 
added to the hip measure may be folded underneath at the left 
side front, as at A. The fold may have ribbon or braid stitched 
down its edges, as at B; or the skirt may be seamed up, 1 1/2 inches 
turned for a heading and the fullness gathered in at the sides as 
at C; or the fullness may be laid in 3 or 4 plaits at each side as 
at D. These plaits should be pressed on a straight crosswise 
thread, placing in the plaits the fullness that was allowed on each
side for the cascades.
A cuff, as at E, cut 2 inches longer than the armhole measure, 
3 to 8 inches deep, and finished to correspond with the finish of 
the dress is desirable, especially for ratiné or wool. The fullness 
allowed at the bottom of the waist may be made into plaits that 
turn toward the under-arm seams at the sides and thus make 
a belt unnecessary.
For wash dresses, a 1 1/4-inch picoted bias ruffle makes an attrac-
tive finish for neck and sleeves. The raw edges
may be bound in when the binding is applied.
For crisp materials, a sash that ties in a bow at
the back is pleasing, especially for young girls.

One Hour Dress Made in 34 Minutes! 

When announcement was first made that 
Mary Brooks Picken of the Woman's Institute
had developed a new plan by which an attrac-
tive dress could be made in an hour, it aroused
tremendous interest among women everywhere. 
Some doubted that such an achievement was 
possible, until the dress was made in a public 
demonstration in the Grand Central Palace, 
New York, in 34 minutes, a fact recorded in 
the New York newspapers and attested to, as 
shown above, by the officials of the National 
Merchandise Fair.

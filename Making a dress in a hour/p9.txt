Step Six-Join the Blouse and Skirt

1 Join skirt and blouse edges evenly
2 Stitch with ¾-inch seam
SKIRT
BLOUSE

You are now ready to join the blouse to the front and back 
skirt sections to shape the dress.

1. Lay the upper or cut lengthwise edge of one skirt section 
along the bottom of the back of the blouse in the position shown 
above. The right side of the skirt material (as to finish or 
design) must be against the right side of the blouse material.
The skirt material will be wider than the blouse and should extend 
the same distance-about 6 or 8 inches-at each side.

NOTE.—An exact way to join the skirt 
and blouse is to fold each edge and clip 
a small notch at the exact center. Then
when the edges are placed together see 
that the notches meet.

2. Stitch the skirt and blouse 
together with a 3/8-inch seam.
Now join the other skirt section 
to the bottom of the front of the 
blouse in exactly the same way.

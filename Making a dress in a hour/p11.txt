Step Eight-Complete the Blouse

1 Pin under-arm
edges evenly

2 Stitch with
⅜-inch seam

You now proceed to join the blouse under arms at each side to 
complete the blouse. Turn the dress right side in.

1. Pin the under-arm edges of the blouse together accurately.

2. Stitch from the sleeve around the curve and down to the 
point where the blouse and skirt join.

Stitch both sides of the blouse together in the same way and 
then turn the dress right side out.

NOTE.—After the under-arm seams of the blouse have been stitched, 
take a needle and thread and tack the joining of the skirt and blouse at 
the intersection of the side seams. In doing this 
a very small plait will be made.
